### Pizza Menu
This project functions as a menu to customize a pizza; selecting different sizes and toppings, and calculating a total price.

### Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A classic! The player faces off against the computer, which randomly selects its piece placement. The winner will enjoy an adorable kitten meow audio clip.

### Calculator
A simple, 4-function calculator. Users may add, subtract, multiply and divide as they would on the basic handheld version.
