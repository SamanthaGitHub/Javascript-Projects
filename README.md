# Javascript-Projects

This repository showcases my projects that utilize JavaScript.


## Calculator
A simple, 4-function calculator. Users may add, subtract, multiply and divide as they would on the basic handheld version.

## Carb Counter
(under construction)

## Pizza Menu
This is not your average pizzeria. This project functions as a menu to customize a pizza; selecting different sizes and toppings, and calculating a total price.

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A classic! The player faces off against the computer, which randomly selects its piece placement. The winner will enjoy an adorable kitten meow audio clip.

## To Do App
Keep track of all your to-dos! This application will track your tasks and you can delete them when you're done. The cache memory ensures you can keep a running list and come back to it as you please.
